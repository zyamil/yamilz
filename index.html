      <p>
        My name is Zetty, but I prefer to be called <b>Yamil</b>. I am from
        Chimbote, Peru. I am single and 21 years old. I decided to pursue a
        bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. I am starting my degree with
        this and some other courses, so I am very excited.
      </p>

        Some of my skills are in math because I love solving problems and
        memorizing formulas. I love music too, I like playing the piano and the
        guitar. And I also ike reading.

        Some months ago I was living with my parents and siblings in Spain.
        During that time I wanted to learn something because I love studying, so
        I decided to learn how to create a website. I started with Youtube
        videos, and I created some websites using basic CSS and HTML. Even
        though I never published them because I didn't know how, I enjoyed
        learning.

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint
        since my baptism when I turned 8. I attended seminary and institue
        classes and gratuated from both of them. One of my favorite scriptures
        is found in Ether 12:27 which gives us the steps for us to become our
        weak things strong.
